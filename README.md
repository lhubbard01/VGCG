**Visual Graphics for Computational Graph Definitions**
This is a graphical user interface for developing computation graphic models on local machines.
It is intended to eventually support model definitions through the GUI, whereby their edges, in a directed, acyclic, feedforward fashion, can be used for generating an intermediate represetnation that is read by a target framework of choice. 
It is intended that the user can create network components in a modular and efficient manner, emphasizing reusability for efficient model definitions.
